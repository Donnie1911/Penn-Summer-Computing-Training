A Jupyter notebook is a useful way of working with python (as well as a few other languages).  We will show you what makes it differnt than a standaline python script, or an ipython session.

How to get Jupyter running will depend on what computer you are running on.  If you have anaconda installed right on your own laptop, sipmly opening an `.ipynb` file should launch a notebook.  On remote computers, often you just go to a certain url.  Sometimes you have to run `jupyter-notebook` from the command line, and deal with some port-forwarding.  

We have included info about how to run Jupyter on devlinlab-01.  We will also help make sure it's working on each of your laptops.
